<font><p align="justify"><strong>proxyMITY</strong> is a  tool developed at IIT Bombay, which enables creation of interactive lessons,
  by  importing lecture video and presentation slides. The name stands for Proxy  Multimedia
  Integration  Tool for You. In any lecture, Presentation slides which fall under a single topic  are grouped together as part of a &lsquo;Theme&rsquo;, which is a searchable attribute. The  presentation slides are then synchronized with the lecture video, on a chosen  timeline. The entire lesson is
  published  in the form of either a desktop standalone application, or as html content to
  be  viewed within a web browser. Students are able to view the published lessons,  and can 
  navigate  to specific topics. The lessons are distributed in Open Source, under the  Creative Commons license. 
<br /><br />An application has  been developed for accessing these lessons on Aakash tablets. Students get  individual access to quality lectures of reputed teachers, for effective  personalized learning. They have the flexibility of studying anytime, anywhere, and at their own pace. A searchable  database storage and retrieval system for students, that enables fast access to  relevant lessons, is being developed. </p></font>
