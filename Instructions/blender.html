<p><strong><h2>Blender Animation</h2></strong></p>
<p align="justify">Blender is a free  and Open Source software product, used for creating animations, rendering,  video editing, etc. Under OSCAR project (<a href="http://oscar.iitb.ac.in/">http://oscar.iitb.ac.in</a>)  at IIT Bombay, several educational animations have been developed, all of which  are made available in Open Source. </p>
<p>Some of these have  been ported to work on Aakash. A few animations for demonstration are loaded on  this tablet.</p>
