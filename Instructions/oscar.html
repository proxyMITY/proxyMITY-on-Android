                <p align="center">
                    The primary objective of Project Oscar is to build the large repository of web based, interactive animated learning objects (LOs) for teaching and learning undergraduate and post graduate science and technology subjects. These self learning interactive objects will help educators to improve their teaching. These LOs will also help students in better understanding of the topic through practice and thereby improving their overall performance. 
                </p> 
                <h2 id="Nav" style="color: blue">Definition of learning objects? </h2>
                <p>Leaning object is a collection of content items, practice  items and assessment items created for a single learning objective. It is a new  concept in IT based education that provides smaller self contained re-usable  units of learning. A single learning object could be used in multiple contexts  for multiple purposes.<br />
                    It is not possible for any teacher to create all the learning material for the  course. The reusability of learning objects offers an efficient way to  facilitate instructions of commonly taught concepts, procedures, applications  and skills to teachers. &nbsp;These animated LOs  help students in visualization of the abstract concepts.</p>
                <h2 id="sub" style="color: blue">Learning Objects on Oscar Site</h2>
                <p align="justify">The top bar of the home page of Oscar contains  many tabs. Touch each tab to know more.
