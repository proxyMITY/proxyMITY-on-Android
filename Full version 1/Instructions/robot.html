<p align="justify">The goal of  &lsquo;e-Yantra&rsquo; project at IIT Bombay, is to create the next generation of (Embedded
System) engineers in  India  who are more practical in their outlook. The project aims at design and  deployment of robots, for enhanced teaching of subjects in Engineering  Colleges, to provide continued education for teachers for quality improvement  in teaching, and to Create Open Courseware for Embedded Systems for engineering  students, based on robots.</p>
<p align="justify">We have developed a Robot-control  application which runs on Aakash. A robot with a mounted camera is controlled by  the Aakash tablet using a Wi-Fi hot spot. Students can control the movement of the  Robot using a simulated touch-controlled joy-stick provided on the tablet.  Simultaneously, the video stream captured by the camera mounted on the Robot,  is transmitted to Aakash, which can be viewed in a window on the tablet.</p>
