                proxyMITY is a tool developed at IIT Bombay, which enables creation of interactive lessons, by importing lecture video and 
                presentation slides. The name stands for Proxy Multimedia
                Integration Tool for You. In any lecture, Presentation slides
                which fall under a single topic are grouped together as part of a &lsquo;Theme&rsquo;, which is a searchable attribute. The presentation slides are then synchronized with the lecture video, on a chosen timeline. The entire lesson is published in the form of either a desktop standalone application, or as html content to be viewed within a web browser. Students are able to view the published lessons, and can navigate to specific topics. The lessons are distributed in Open Source, under the Creative Commons license.<br />
                An application has been developed for accessing these lessons on 
                Aakash tablets. Students get individual access to quality lectures
                of reputed teachers, for effective personalized learning. They 
                have the flexibility of studying anytime, anywhere, and at their
                own pace. A searchable database storage and retrieval system for
                students, that enables fast access to relevant lessons, is being
                developed.
