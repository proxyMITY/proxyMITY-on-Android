<h2><font>Clicker</font></h2>
<p>In a classroom  environment, interaction between instructor and participants is the most 
  crucial factor for  effective learning. Clicker devices are used to collect instant feedback 
  from a large number  of students, either as a response to a question, or to a quiz. IIT Bombay had  developed a low cost clicker device, and a complete system which was used for  conducting quizzes. This application system has been successfully ported on  Aakash. Clicker response collection is now available through a web based  interface.
  Since Aakash is more  powerful than an ordinary clicker device, several useful features have been  added. A quiz question now gets fully downloaded on individual student&rsquo;s Aakash  tablet, through Wi-Fi. A multiple question test can now be conducted. All the  questions of such a test are downloaded on the student tablet. Time control is  maintained by Aakash. At the end of the test time, all answers are  automatically collected, and individual scores get recorded in the back-end  system.<br />
<br />This application can  run only when the complete software is working on the back-end server, which  can connect to the Aakash tablets with students using Wi-Fi. </p>
